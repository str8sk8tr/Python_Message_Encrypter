# Python_Message_Encrypter:

The program will ask you if you want to create a secret message -The program rearranges the order of letters in a message so that the message can't be understood, by working out which letters are in even or odd position. Then it swaps the position of each pair of letters in the message, scrambling the meaning (Encryption). 

The program will ask you if you want to reveal a secret message - The program will than make the encrypted message readable again by switching the letters back to where they were started (Decryption).
